Readme for Andrew Rusli HTML/CSS Test.

TO START:

Open the .html file in a browser. (It works best in chrome, although I tried to make cross-compatible with firefox.)


NOTES:

Overall, I think my page is close, but not 'pixel-perfect'. It looks very close to the eye, and is functionally identical. 

I noticed that some things get lost in translation between the Figma design and the real page. For example, sometimes the pixel border/margin on a live webpage is a by-product of the responsive design, and therefore adjusts along with the viewsize. But in a Figma doc, you can't tell if the designer intends the margins/borders/alignment to be exact, or if it is intended to flow along with the responsive elements of the page (like a snapshot of a larger responsive design). My natural instinct is to set more fluid elements, but the assignment requested 'pixel-perfect' design, which I found very hard to implement on a real responsive page. What I've turned in is a page that sits somewhere between these two ideas. 

I think my final submission looks quite close to the eye, but I'm not satisfied with how it's constructed. Trying to match pixel details with the Figma design resulted in me hard-coding in lots of tiny margin, pixel, and border details. This resulted in a CSS doc that is admittedly cluttered and repetitive. This is not the kind of code that I ideally want to write, but I felt limited by time and uncertainty about what the figma designer intended.

If I were to work in this role in the future, I think I would try to implement much more consistency and resuability in the CSS, and probably would like to become more proficient in a pre-processor, or use bootstrap/another library. I feel I'm lacking in knowledge of best CSS practices at this point, but with proper guidance and some pointers from more experienced developers and designers, I know I could improve quickly.
