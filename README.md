Readme for Andrew Rusli HTML/CSS Test.

To start application: Open the .html file in a browser. (It works best in chrome, although I tried to make cross-compatible with firefox.)

NOTES:

Overall, I think my page is close, but not 'pixel-perfect'. It looks very close to the eye, and is functionally identical. 

I noticed that some things get lost in translation between the Figma design and the real page. For example, sometimes the pixel border/margin on a live webpage is a by-product of the responsive design, and therefore adjusts along with the viewsize. But in a Figma doc, there is no way to tell if the designer intends the margins/borders/alignment to be exact, or if it is intended to flow along with the responsive elements of the page (like a snapshot of a more responsive design). My natural instinct is to set more fluid elements, but the assignment request 'pixel-perfect' design, which I found very hard to implement on a real responsive page. Basically, what I've turned in is a page that sits somewhere between these two ideas. Also there were no instructions on how to handle the responsive design in-between the very small mobile screen and the large desktop screen. 

I think my final submission looks very close to the eye, but I am not satisfied with how it's constructed. To try to match tiny details up with the Figma design resulted in me hard-coding in lots of tiny margin, pixel, and border details. This resulted in a CSS doc that is cluttered, repetitive, and is not very re-usable or clean. This is not the kind of code that I want to write, but I felt limited by time and the constraints of the assignment.

If I were to work in this role in the future, I think I would try to implement much more consistency and resuability in the CSS, and probably would like to become more proficient in a pre-processor, or use bootstrap/another library. I feel I'm lacking in knowledge of CSS best practices at this point, but I'm always learning. 

I understand what the issues are with my design, and with proper guidance and some pointers from more experienced designers, I know I could improve quickly.
